# TU Skyline

This is a canteen run by the Studentenwerk, but they do have some above-average food there. The nice part is that this is probably the only place in Berlin where you can enjoy a view like from the Fernsehturm while having lunch for 3.50â‚¬.

## Address

20th floor of the high rise at Ernst-Reuter-Platz
