# Streamer Coffee Componay

There are shops in Tokyo/Harajuku, Tokyo/Shibuya and Osaka. Having been
to the main one in Shibuya, I can say that the coffee is delicious. On
the menu, there are mostly Latte variations (with great Latte art). They
do of course roast their own beans.

Since at least the Shibuya shop is quite small, you might feel compelled
to go with a takeout. Don't do this. Don't drink their stuff from
takeout paper cup, ever.
